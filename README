Django app that runs on your laptop and creates a local cache of the
popular Achewood comic strip, so that you may read it in a place such
as the train or wherever else a lack of internet is.

Based on an earlier non-django python script by Christian Swinehart.

NOTE: I have a deep and everlasting love for Mr. Onstad and his pantheon
of fantastic animals and that is why I made this, not to somehow evade
his copyrights or anything like that. It's so that one can read the strip
locally on your laptop and any other infringing uses are stupid.

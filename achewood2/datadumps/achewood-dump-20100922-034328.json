A powerful publishing exectuve for New York City contacts him: her prized dachshund has become violent and unpredictable after a traumatic spay. Briggs creates a therapeutic burrow out of the womans couch cushions and then wiggles down into where the dachhund has hidden itself. He whispers secret, private dachshund ideas to the creature, who soon emerges from her self-imposed prison with a new self confidence and a heavily chewed squeaky rubber mallard.\nViolence, whispers. 170 minutes.

It seems to me that you have no qualifications whatsoever. S.D., Internet\nRay: Dear S.D., Its funny: at first this letter sounded like kind of an insult to me.\nRay (typing): But when I re-read it, it just sounded like an honest question that my readers deserve to have answered.\nRay: Advice columnists are kind of a unique lot, like blimp pilots, in that were mostly self-taught. \nRay: I personally started by reading a few sections in this really old Amy Vanderbilt etiquette book that I found sealed in a plastic bag in the toilet tank.\r / Ray (out loud): That was so weird!\nRay (typing): It was mostly about, like, where to put your fork if the King is over for dinner, or how to instruct the maid to fold tennis whites for guests who are playing before luncheon, but it sparked something in me. I had been bitten by the advice bug.\nRay (out loud): Alright, this is getting boring.\nRay (typing): Okay, I have to go run some errands. Up yours if this was actually meant to be an insult (but not up yours if not). -Ray\nFooter: Find more great advice every Wednesday in Rays Place!\nhttp://achewood.com/index.php?date=07242003\n",

Like so, it features a cuttable frame for a probable custom filling book]]\r / Beer Can Chicken\nRay Says: This is a recipe I always like to make when I have a special lady over. The bird cooks for about an hour and a half, during which time you can serve champagne and see where things lead. I often find that there is a point during the preparation at which you will sense that the lady has resigned herself to your power and charm. If this happens, just turn the oven off and forget about dinner. Throw the chicken away the next day.\nIngredients:\r / A 5-lb, chicken with all the guts teared out\r / 1 aluminum can of beer, half full\r / 1tsp onion powder\r / 1tsp garlic powder\r / 1/2tsp salt\r / 1/2tsp pepper\r / Spray oil\r / (Its not real complicated)\nProcedure:\r / Preheat the oven to 400F. Line a small roasting pan with foil (shiny-side down). Pour all the seasonings into the beer can and stick it into the big butt opening of the chicken. See if the lady notices. Then sit the chicken upright, like he was in a chair, onto the roasting pan, using the beer can as his base. Spray his skin all over with the oil (this will make it crispy). Throw salt and pepper all over his skin and then stick him in the oven for like a hour and a half. The fluid and seasonings in the beer can will steam all up through the bird and flavor it, as well as keep it real moist.\nMake sure that a meat thermometer stuck into the deepest part of the breast and deepest part of the thigh registers at least 160-170F. Juices should be clear and not pink. Let sit 10 minutes.\n[[outside cutting frame]]\nThis recipe appears in both Volume I and the Achewood Cookbook. All bound volumes contain special print-only content.\n{{alt text: If you dont own the printed collections, you are Lobby.}}\nhttp://achewood.com/index.php?date=08272004\n",

The page reads as follows:]]\nAchewood Community College - Electives!\r / All Electives! courses count towards the Mix-n-Match portion of your degree.\nAl Roker Body Mass Timeline\r / Fridays, 1 unit\r / Instructor has a large easel, on which are stacked silhouettes of Al Rokers body mass over time. Instructor peels away, one leaf per class, revealing the next exciting turn his body took.\nWino Poker\r / Tuesdays, 1 unit\r / In this class, local winos are collected from various encampments along the railroad tracks and made to play poker in a police interrogation room. They wear red foam noses and undersized bowlers. The winos are each awarded one unit. Would make a good painting.\nCrpes Suzette\r / Wednesdays, 1 unit\r / Does listening to sad music make you sad? Then come listen to the music of Crpes Suzette, a French pop band who always include samples of themselves and ladies having orgasms together, often three-at-a-time.\nHate is a Fag\r / Thursdays, 2 units\r / Transitional mentality course for those who hate homosexuals, yet hate themselves for hating homosexuals. Course concludes with a film of a man who can put his **** into his own *** while punching himself in the face.\nIntro to Watercolors\r / Fridays, 2 units\r / In this class, students will learn the basics of painting with watercolors. Please consult page eight for list of required supplies.\nPredictive Text Messaging: The Italians\r / Mondays, 2 units\r / Many modern cell phones have a system where you type a portion of a word and it guesses the rest of the word for you. This is meant to save you time. There is a rumor that the Italians are very good at this because they use it so much. In this class, several Italian guest speakers answer your questions via a cell phone hooked up to an overhead projector.\nPopular Items\r / Tuesdays, 1 unit\r / The Scion van is popular, as is the Livestrong bracelet. Eating chicken is popular again. Rollerblading has gone into a strong fade. Bed-head is still popular with models and rock bands. Muscles maintain their timeless chic.\nKnow Your Fast Food\r / Fridays, 1 unit\r / Carls Jr. can always be counted upon as the fast food restaurant whose burger-dressing vegetables are cut in such a way as to imply a homey non-perfection. However, what are other fast-food restaurants doing to create various impressions? Standard enrollment fee plus $5 for van privileges.\nWorld Time Zone Chart\r / 1 unit\r / Laminated. Available in the Book Shop. (does not meet) $5.\n{{ AUTO SHOP 154 - recreate the car that Johnny Cash describes in One Piece at a Time }}\nhttp://achewood.com/index.php?date=08112004\n",

Through the bars on the windows he can see dusty shelves and glass cabinets filled with a variety of dimly lit curios.  Among them he enumerates sets of asian jars, baby animals in ether, intricately detailed models of wooden sailing ships, obscure cookware, stringed instruments, tin soldiers, sagging leatherbound volumes, and great containers of multicolred candies.  However, the objects which hold the most fascination for him are a life-size stuffed bear and mallar.\r / The child stares at them incessantly, sure that if his attention is directed toward them long enough they will come to show signs of life.  Season after season, year after year, in full summer sun and driving snow, the boy steals away from his chores to come look in the window.  He stands motionless, intent, looking into the dim glow of the locked shop on the ever-deserted alleyway, peering unceasingly into the eyes of the bear and bird.  Never moving, never changing, they perpetually stare into the distance.  Eventually the child goes insane.\r / ``Sullivans Bear and Dried Bird stands alone in its vivid depiction of the effects a prolonged exposure to achewater can have on the central nervous system. While the identity of the author remains a subject of some contention, lines like ``staring past the orange brocade/the brain in lively marinade and ``still water fooled the lonely duck/the beak sucked in the devils muck hint that the slave liquor had made its way into a more literate circle of society and may well have been penned by an aristocratic addict.\r / -- Joel Steinmetz\r / Boston, MA 1975\r / {{Tooltip: Merry Christmas, a page from the aborted Volume I project}}\nhttp://achewood.com/index.php?date=12242004\n",

[...] Vol 7 No. 10\r / Body: Friday Facts!\r / by Philippe, editor-in-chief!\nThis week: WORLD FACTS!\n***CHINESE FOOD***\r / Chow Mein is the Chinese version of spaghetti but if you put tomato sauce on it, Chinese people will be aghast!\nChow Fun is a fat noodle, about eight Chow Meins wide (still no sauce though).\nPolice: NEVER let a youth gang make fun of an older Chinese man on his way home at night. NEVER, EVER let them knock his hat off. I cried when I saw this.\r / ***\nIRISH PEOPLE have heard it all before, so you can take a hike.\nTHE PRESIDENT OF SPAIN is the only President in the world who wears red jens to work! He doesnt bat an eye!\nAUSTRALIAN people... where do I begin. They have hearts full of love! Their women laugh pretty loud though.\nGERMANS dont like peanut butter or root beer! (They prefer butter and beer -- simplicity equals perfection!)\n[[Picture]]\r / Caption: A boy from another land thinks about America.\nITALY is the only country in the world where men are allowed to cry or pee in public.\nRUSSIA is thought of as a cold place, where serious men eat snow and throw cats at walls. You wont catch me going there, not for a million bucks.\nSWEDISH PEOPLE crave silence.\nAMERICANS have got it all! BBQ, tanks, rockets, football (our definition), and spaceships! Is it any wonder why the rest of the world always thinks about us when trying to accomplish a feat or a marvel?! I tell you, America is the place for me! If you are from another country, come here and I will show you what makes this country so great! (I get up around seven and we can hang out for an hour or so before the good shows come on.)\n[[Note from Beef]]\r / Philippe is the editor of the Philippe Times. At five years old, he is my boss, and I am using this sentence to see if he even reads the paper once I have laid it out using QuarkXPress and printed it on the laser printer.\r / --Roast Beef\r / Production Manager\nhttp://achewood.com/index.php?date=08192005\n",

Favorites Brad Sweden and The Toronto Man Machine fell surprisingly early on Day Two, and this lone horse deftly avoided all allegiances, a risky tactic scarcely tried here on the Acres. Stubbs remained reticent on his victory.  I just beat the asses of three thousand men.  The hell you leave me alone, he said.]]\r / [[Also shown is an I RIDE WITH RODNEY button, and a ticket for the 1973 GOF.]]\r / [[Text on ticket: ADMIT ONE, WATCH MAN DESTROY MAN AT THE 1973 GREAT OUTDOOR FIGHT, FEBRUARY 5 - 12pm THE ACRES - GEN.

Always fightin as a team, Roast Beef usin brains, Ray usin brawn...\nRamses: Problem IS, only one man can win this Fight!\r / Ray: Its okay, dad, Beef said hed lay it down for me! Im gonna drop him easy. \nRamses: I though you rookies might get up to as much. A lay-down aint gonna fly with the men in the tower, you realize. They see anything short of a cold, ruthless ass-beatin, theyll bring out the Jeeps. \nRoast Beef: Oh not the Jeeps no Ray we aint goin that route please\nRay: But... but I cant beat real on Beef! Hes my oldest friend!\nRamses: If thats the arrangement, you got to beat him till his blood runs, boy. You got to beat him till he cant crawl, see, or cry. Those are the rules, and all eyes are on you.\nhttp://achewood.com/index.php?date=03172006\n",

Steam Keys Haskell\nJ-Boy laid back on the couch, naked as hell, and twice as horny. Maria, insane with ass, did Miami claps with her booty. This made J-Boy say that she was so hot. The words came out of his mouth before he knew what was happening. She had her perfectly identical breasts going this way and that. It was about eighty-five degrees, and their bodies naturally produced a cooling layer of sweat.\nJ-Boy took a hit of marijuana from a small bong shaped like a chisel-tip marker. He liked to think that if the police ever came to his house, they would just see the bong as a school supply. He blew the smoke up in Marias face, only she wasnt there. She had gone to turn up the music on the CD player. It was Jah Rhymes ultra-club mix of Da Riggy, fast and pulsating with beats. He set the bong aside to a place where it was unlikely to get knocked over and spill its smelly water on the floor, as that would ruin the sex energy of the room.\nMaria came back over to the couch, only he was no longer there. She heard sounds coming from the apartments small kitchen. If she knew anything, she knew that that was where he had gone. The apartment had three rooms, and was hard to hide in. Also, why would he hide from her? He wouldnt. He had said so, earlier, when she had shown up at his door.\nShe walked her sexy legs into the kitchen, and saw that he was breaking some eggs into a pan. The microwave showed that it was cooking something for thirty minutes, so she asked about that. Oh, he said. That was supposed to be three minutes. My bad.\nThe eggs sizzled in the pan. He pointed to a poster for a movie that had be out about twelve years ago. The movie had been adapted from a novel his grandpa had written, he said. She looked at the poster. From a novel by Sheldon Handler, part of the credits read. J-Boys last name was Handler? She hadnt known.\nJ-Boy ate a snack of eggs, cooked a little too long so that they had brown lacy crust on both sides, and microwaved hashbrown potatoes, which were clearish-white and extremely sticky. He sucked down a Molson, and then another, for energy. For fun. They hadnt been in the fridge yet, and so they foamed a bunch: [italics]aww yeah.[/italics] He watched twelve minutes of Breed All About It on Animal Planet and fell asleep. In the bathroom, Maria Googled his family on his wireless laptop. Then she looked at MySpace pages of people who had an interest in his grandfathers novel.\nhttp://achewood.com/index.php?date=08242006\n",

Phrases that are English in one direction, and a different language when read backwards.\r / PHILIPPE: Oh! Do you mean like if a beatnik who isnt proud of himself wants to talk to you, so first he says, So, cat...a rap: all it rot?\nMR. BEAR: I--my dear boy! This...this is phenomenal! Have you always had this ability?\r / PHILIPPE: Oh gosh, I wouldnt call it an ability. Its just somethin I can do. Crib bickerer!\nMR. BEAR: Rerkib bir!

BEAR (TYPING): Little Philippe continues to confound me. On one day, he might spend five hours wrapping his lower extremities in wet toilet tissue, only to throw a tantrum when no one is around to photograph him in the hardened mass. The next, he might speak in bilingual palindromes, or lead a frog through a makeshift obstacle course using only a small tatter of yellow madras.

Its sugar melted down with cream and water!\nLIGHT SPEED:\r / Light travels really fast - 186,281 miles per second - much faster than we need it to.  It turns out that most of the time we only need light to travel about thirty-five miles per hour, the same speed as a *Dodge Neon.*\nCAN KNIGHTS DISAGREE WITH POLICEMEN?\r / Only on neutral ground, such as *Iceland*.  Fact.\nACORN UPDATE\r / Yeah, dont eat em.\nGUESS JAR\r / Everybody knows that Ill make some mistakes each day.  Heres a fun social orthotic [Cornelius said those words]: set up a *Guess Jar*!  Every time someone wants to guess what my daily mistakes will be, they put a coin in the Guess Jar.  Then they can say their guesses out loud!\n[[Woodcut of a naked man with shaggy hair approaching a pedestal, around which is entwined a serpent.  Contains the words GENIUS ??? ???.]]\r / Fig 1. *The first genius*.\n*Dogs* cant drink from straws!  No lips.  Not good ones, anyway.  More like mouth edges.  Sheesh!  How many Sundays DID *God* take off, anyways?!  I think God owes dogs some do-overs.\n*In the This Is Crazy Department:*\r / Scallops can swim!  They dont just stay stuck to the sea bed like oysters or clams!  Oh my god I almost barfed on the ground when I saw Animal Planets show about scallops and one shot up and swam away like a crazy catchers mitt.\n*Envirotek Deck Restoration* will give you 10% off sanding and sealing!  This is our first ad.  Not quite sure how this works.  I dont think you call me.  I think you call them.  Tell them Im running their ad.\nChris has put over fifty dollars in the Guess Jar.  He says its cheaper than therapy or *bullets*.\nTHE BIG RELIGIONS:\r / Christian, Buddhist, Islam, Hindu.  *Also*: Jewish.\nThe best painting in the world?  The *Mona Lisa*.  Hands down.\nLYLE just beat a guy up!  He says the guy really *bent over and took it*, too.  I dont like fighting but Lyle is very inspirational with his energy.  I think he could run a great church if he wasnt the opposite of a church.\nhttp://achewood.com/index.php?date=10202006\n",

That time.\nMOLLY: The one in the bathroom? Where you told me about how dirty toilets are, even if they get cleaned? Because of the porous surfaces? And you actually started yelling and got on kind of a high horse about all of it? \nME: Oh my god dont mention about that what in the hell! This is for a magazine!\nMOLLY: Sorry, maybe you can ask me about something else. Its your magazine, babe. \nME: Okay like so we know that you are from Wales, right?\nMOLLY: Yeah, my family was on the Gwynqeathe, a ship that sank between Fladceate, Wales, and New Amsterdam in 1676\nME: So when you say New Amsterdam you really mean New York.\nMOLLY: Duh, nerd. But thats what it was called at the time. \nME: And since then you just hung out in heaven kind of mellow and keeping tabs on things. Until this rude bag of chilies and pistols came along [points to self].\nMOLLY: Yeah. Im not the type of person who goes out and tries to forge new trails. Im more of a homebody. Like you. If I have new things to read and a few favorite movies, Im fine. I dont need to go hiking. I know the mountains there, and that its wonderful. Ill probably see it, eventually. \nME: Oh uh I aint a homebody by any means Im just real real careful about leavin the house in regards to peak traffic hours and hours when the sun rays are particularly cancerous. You know how drunk people are always drivin up on sidewalks and you also know about how the atmosphere is about allowin  certain bad rays through at certain hours. Thats why they always shoot movies real early in the morning, its because Scientology tells the big stars about how daytime light is the most dangerous. Im almost sure that I agree. \nMOLLY: I thought that had more to do with the quality of light early in the morning. Its more friendly to film, it looks warmer. \nME: Well, thats definitely an information-soft answer. \nMOLLY: Dont be an ass. We still have to go out to dinner after this, and I want to have a nice time. \nME: Well whose fault is that.\nMOLLY: Mine. Im the only one in this house capable of calling in to a radio show and winning dinner for two at Mes Beauchamps Restaurant and Wine Bar.\nME: And tell them just what question you answered to get this prize. \nMOLLY: Who was the only blond member of the Traveling Wilburys.\nME: Jesus christ how could you know stuff like that! [re-enacting my original aghastness] \nMOLLY: Tom Petty. Dylan, Harrison, Orbison...all brunettes. \nME: Did you also know that the Traveling Wilburys was the ugliest circle of men ever to have millions of\n[cont] \n{{alt text: The Story of Molly Sanders.}}\nhttp://achewood.com/index.php?date=01232007\n",

Anyhow, dont worry crafters, this aint gonna soften up as a zine and start appearin at the grocery checkout next to Redbook. (Can someone please tell me what in hell that magazine even is.) You aint gonna find an article about how to make a nice sash to hide your balls when you are an otherwise naked high-ranking Swiss military officer. You aint gonna see a piece about the ups and downs and happy-sappy overall ups of bein hitched. There will not be a large type edition, or an edition that Oprah can like. This zine is gonna stay dirty and low and stupid and useless, just like I swore to Jesus on the day he gave me this keyboard and showed me that picture of two sets of footprints goin down a beach, and theres this one stretch where theres only one set of footprints, and I was like, whats that all about, and He said, Ed E. Haskell, that was when you were writing MAN WHY YOU EVEN GOT TO DO A THING. So it is said. Enjoy the new issue, I think its the fifth one. -EEH\nCurse of the Sea Bitch and Braebicus Dict updates:\r / Alright so once again I didnt feel like writin that complicated shit. So sue me. That stuff takes so much research and plus to write Braebicus dict I usually need to be in a fight with Miss Lady and we aint been in a fight lately.\nRays saying of the minute:\r / Gettin all spry on Grolsch\nIN THIS ISSUE!\r / RAYS NUDITY\r / When one man is having a hard time getting photographed naked, what on the earth can he do to get his nudity out there.\r / INTERVIEW: PHILIPPE\r / Philippe is a kid from this place and I go head-to-head with him for a little while that turns into a long while and also money becomes involved because he makes a terrible mistake\r / TODD TIPS\r / Todd has been livin on the fringes for basically every second and now he finally gives some advice back to society\r / JIMMY CONVERSATIONS\r / Everybody sees a homeless dude with regularity but not so often does he get some zine space.

Hand em over.\r / FLUT\n[[The list of ideas reads as follows:]]\r / 1. Stupid Clam! Todd does coke and hits clams with hammers. Music: metal.\r / 2. Todd does coke and then uses karate chops to break CDs (he also yells at anybody he wants)\r / 3. Todd gets high on coke and wrestles a lobster in a freezer. As the lobster freezes, Todd slowly wins\r / 4. A sex scene involving Todd and whatever Todd wants\nRay: Thats any late night skit show. Just air the parts that aint about cocaine and selfish sex. Old industry secret.\nRoast Beef: If we let Todd just do what he wants like this hell burn out and die from problems dude!\r / Ray: ...well start the ghostwriter on the tell-all now, and get bidding going on the other 50% of the footage for when he croaks.

I fear I may pay her another compliment! Yn Duw, Cwynn Cleddoc.\nAs lil nephew looks on, Lowerth continues: In a post-script he places an order for another bra, this time in dark colours! Tell me, dear Charley, what other ideas yawn in yer fertile brain?\nLil Nephew, up close: Well, honest, man, the toilet scene in history is straight bodankey. You all got fine hats but you poop in a bowl in the room where you sleep?\nAn angry Lowerth: What of it? Name me a finer solution!\r / Lil Nephew, with his salesman on: Dude. A private room, with a water system that washes the mess away into a hidden pit.\nLowerth, still angry: Insanity! Such home irrigation would rival the Hanging Gardens of Babylon for outlay and upkeep!\r / Lil Nephew: Ima go out in the backyard and build one. You see if it dont make sense when Im done.\nCaption: SOON  In the backyard stands the contraption. Its made of two steel drums, with poorly welded pipe connections between, a hand operated water pump handle in the top drum, an outtake pipe trailing forward of the painful looking wooden seat. A long steel protrusion holds the perforated toilet paper roll.\nLowerth, scratching his old chin thoughtfully: Interesting. I know not whether to piss in it or wish it well on its voyage to the new world.\r / Lil Nephew: Put your ass where your mouth is, old man. I got a track record.\nCaption: THEN\r / Lowerth sits on the contraption, pants around ankles, but long shirt maintains his modesty. His legs are surprisingly muscular. He is pulling the water pump handle.\r / Lowerth: Why....this pleases me! And I feel proud to use the handle!\nA pleased Lowerth holds a proud hand on Lil Nephews shoulder: Dear boy, commit to paper ten more of these inventions, and we shall call a convocation of marvels... They will shock from far and wide to sample of your genius!\nAn old school flyer: COME ONE, COME ALL! THIS SATURDAY! \r / I. Sanders  Son. 12 Stryd Ych. \r / INVENTIONS ON DISPLAY: The TOILET.

He knew what to do.\r / Philippe: [[Thinking to himself:]] What should he do? A good writer would know this. \nWaiter, he said, When she wakes up, make sure she is wearing this ring. He gave the guy a wedding ring. The waiter was named Carlton F. Mintonado.\nCertainly, sir. The waiter expertly licked the inside of the ring and slipped it onto her wedding finger. Haha! laughed Jack. Youve done this before!\r / Philippe: Ha ha!\nThe country club can meet any need, said the waiter. Soon, the lady woke up. Her finger felt new, it felt different. She looked at it. She gasped. \n[[Philippe runs off on his merry way]]\r / Are we...? she tried to ask, starting to blush again. Jack smiled and got up.

The stage is about four times as long as the four-poster which, combined with the wallpaper, makes Roast Beef seem quite small and vulnerable.  The bed is on the left of the stage, and on the right is a wide door with what looks like a mail slot, only it is in the top panel of the door, not the bottom.  Two heavy curtains frame the panel as well as the stage.]]\n[[There is no change in Roast Beefs face, but the door is slowly opening.

Rays head has been sliced right along the corpus collusum by the The Lash of Thanatos book Roast Beef lost hold of in the previous comic.

Do you:\r / a) Indicate toward the shoulder for five seconds, then activate your hazard lights as you slow to a crawl\r / b) Not consume alcohol for three hours prior\r / c) Accelerate to disperse, as boxes generally do not contain living things or weights\r / d) Alert the driver behind you by performing a series of measured swerves\n30.

The background is hell of musical notation.]]\n[[The following are quotes from newspapers, magazines.]]\nUnknown Reviewer: ASS IN YOUR PANTS THIS YEARS MOST IMPORTANT SONG\nMichael Chabon: Ragtime is a musical form woven from the starched Negro collar of early bordello servitude, an apprenticeship in American sin which charmed volumes of this countrys well-heeled and well-to-do.  Ray Smuckles is, perhaps, the most shining example of a modern American artist in his creative prime.  Ragtime is his megaphone and hip-hop is that hand that holds it.\nTIME: In a land ravaged by terror, in a time of social uncertainty and political alienation, artist Ray Smuckles has crafted an anthemic crossover masterpiece where ragtime piano meets up with a hip-hop bullet that goes straight into your pants.\nDouglas Coupland: In a nation of broadband apathy, the pierced avenues of your local Tower Records are something like a roll call for reform... reporting to [Ray Smuckles] Ragtime Detnetion Center is like pacing steadily toward the altar of... the only modern cultural validation whcich can even be said to exist.\n{{oh my goodness}}\nhttp://achewood.com/index.php?date=11192002\n",

I couldnt figure out if I should call him or not.\n[[Pat looks angrily at his answering machine.]]\nTeodor: (on answering machine) Hey Pat, this is Teodor.  Hey... I just wanted to say, uh...good job on...well...congratulations on coming out. I mean, of the closet.  The...gay...closet.  Yesterday.\n[[Back to the greens.]]\nRay: Nah, dont worry about it.  Hes still kind of weird about certain basic aspects of the whole thing. \r / Ray: Im thinking of gettin him a little sedan or something, you know, maybe in a week or two.\nTeodor: Why?\r / Ray: Man, hes driving like a 1979 Mustang with politics bumper stickers!  Aint no fresh young daddy gonna spring into that thing.\nTeodor: Arent there certain cars that gay guys like better than sedans?  Like red Jeep Wranglers, I think thats one.\nRay:  I know the photo shoot youre thinkin of--that one where both dudes have those yellow suede workboots?  --but in reality the Wrangler is a totally horrible car.  Thing handles like a damn keg.\nRay:  I got this theory that all gay dudes secretly want practical four-door sedans.  This is my way of sayin to Pat, Hey, man.  We aint need no frontin around here.  Just be you.\nTeodor:  You might also want to include that in a written note, because Pat will have no idea why you just bought him a sedan.\nRay: Youd be surprised, T.  Gay guys think like in an instant.\r / Ray: Next time youre over Ill show you my video of these secret soccer trials they ran on gay dudes back in the 70s.

Hes found a few blokes wholl gripe about Arsenal with him, and consequently So-Rods ranks have swelled by about a dozen wankers!\n(Computer Screen/Blog): Speaking of rank-swelling, Team Rodneys own Leander, a piscine local lad bent on the three-chord stuff, hooked up with a gaggle of mosh pit yobs and brought another twenty-odd souls into our mix.\r / Todor: Ray wouldnt roll with guys like that!
